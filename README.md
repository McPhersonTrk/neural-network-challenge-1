## Description

This repository, "neural-network-challenge-1", contains a machine learning project focused on predicting student loan risk using deep learning techniques. The project utilizes a dataset with various features related to students' financial situations, academic backgrounds, and career goals to train a neural network model capable of assessing the risk associated with student loans.

## Project Structure

- `student-loans.csv`: The main dataset used for training the neural network. It includes various features such as payment history, GPA ranking, alumni success, and more.
- `student_loans_with_deep_learning.ipynb`: Contains the Python code for preparing the data, creating, training, and evaluating the neural network model.
- `student_loan_model.keras`: The trained neural network model saved as a Keras file for future predictions.

## Project Highlights

- This project demonstrates the application of deep learning to assess the risk associated with student loans.
- The neural network model uses features like financial information, career goals, and academic achievements to make predictions.
- The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics, and the results are saved for further analysis.

## Challenges

- **Data Privacy and Security**: Ensuring the protection of sensitive financial and personal information is paramount.
- **Bias and Fairness**: Addressing potential biases in the data to make fair and equitable loan risk predictions.
- **Dynamic Loan Terms and Regulations**: Keeping the model updated with the latest loan terms and regulations.
- **Individual Circumstances and Future Uncertainties**: Accounting for the variability in students' future financial situations.

## Conclusion

The "neural-network-challenge-1" project showcases how deep learning can be applied to the financial sector, specifically in evaluating student loan risk. By addressing real-world challenges and ensuring fairness and security, this project paves the way for more informed and equitable student loan decisions.
